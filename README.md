# SvgEase

Lottie animations store

## About this project

Svg Ease is an ecommerce app that I did for practice, so you can't actually buy anything. All the payment methods are in developer mode and I don't have plans to put them in production mode.

This dummy store sells Lottie animations, which are json files that contain all the data to play svg animation with this library.

The site is in Spanish.
