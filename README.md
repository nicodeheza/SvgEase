# SvgEase

Lottie animations store

## About this project

Svg Ease is a ecommerce app that I did for practice, so you can't actually buy nothing. All the payment method are in developer mode and I don't have plans to put them in production mode.

This dummy store sells Lottie animations, which are json files that contain all the data to play svg animation with this library.
